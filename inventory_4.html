                <p>As the life of a slave goes, Kantees doesn't have it too bad. Being responsible for a racing dragon
                    means her existence is more than just drudgery and fear, even if her life is at the whim of her
                    masters and their rules.

                    But when her dragon wakes her in the middle of the night Kantees is forced to make a life-or-death
                    decision that breaks her mastersâ€™ rules and means her own life is forfeit.

                    Escaping on the back of dragons, with a hodgepodge of unwelcome associates, she attempts to right a
                    wrong that can never be fixed. Until, ultimately, she must put her own life on the line to keep the
                    freedom she has stolen for herself.
