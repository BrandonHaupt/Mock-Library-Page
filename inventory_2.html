            <h4>by J.K Rowling</h4>
            <div class="book-description">
                <p>Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a Cloak of
                    Invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with
                    the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny
                    Cupboard Under the Stairs, he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years, and his birthday present is
                    his uncle's old socks. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl
                    messenger. A letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds
                    not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been
                    waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter.
