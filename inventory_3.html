            <div class="book-description">
                <p>Nicholas Flamel is the greatest Alchemyst to ever live. The records show that he died in 1418, but
                    what if he's actually been making the elixir of life for centuries?
                    The secrets to eternal life are hidden within the book he protectsâ€”the Book of Abraham the Mage.
                    It's the most powerful book that has ever existed, and in the wrong hands, it will destroy the
                    world. And that's exactly what Dr. John Dee plans to do when he steals it.
                    There is one hope. If the prophecy is true, Sophie and Josh Newman have the power to save everyone.
                    Now they just have to learn to use it.
